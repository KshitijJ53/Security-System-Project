# Security-System-Project

This project is based on the Security System Project in C++. We made a project using C++ language, in which there are various options like registration, login, change password, etc. We used different concepts of C++ programming language, like switch case statements, loops, arrays, file handling operations, etc., to create this Security System Project in C++. In this C++ Project, user can register, login, and then, if he/she wish to change the password, they can also do that by clicking on the change password option.
